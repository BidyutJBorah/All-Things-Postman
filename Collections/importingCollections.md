# Import Collections into Postman

During these examples we will be building up a Collection of requests, The most upto date Collection will live in the `Collections` directory. You can import this file locally by following the steps below:

* Press the `Import` button, you can find this in the top left of the appliction  
* In the `Import File` tab, Either drop the collection file into the grey shaded area or navigate to the file on your machine using the `Choose Files` button
* A message will be displayed to confirm that the file has been successfully imported

If everything has gone to plan, you should be able to see and use the Collection. See below for a quick clip showing the process.
